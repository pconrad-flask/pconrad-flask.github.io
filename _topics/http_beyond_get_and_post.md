Typically, the first time you need anything beyond GET and POST is when you are dealing with so-called RESTful APIs.

# References on RESTful APIs

* Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>

# References on HTTP Methods beyond GET and POST

* HTTP Method registry: <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods/http-methods.xhtml>
