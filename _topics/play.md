# Getting started with Play on Mac

The recommended first step is to install a tool called `sbt` (Scala Build Tool); it isn't strictly necessary, but it does have certain advantages.

On Mac, you can use:

```
brew install sbt
```


Then:

You may like to fork this github repo: <https://github.com/playframework/play-java>   , then clone the fork, cd into the directory and run `sbt`

The tutorial there also recommends installing something called "Activator", from here: https://www.lightbend.com/activator/download
