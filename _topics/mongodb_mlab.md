# Signing up for an mlab account

To sign up for an account, visit  <http://mlab.com> and click "Signup".

As of this writing (November 2016) you could sign up for <b>free</b> mlab account, and create a modest number of mlab databases with
fairly generous disk space quotas, <b>without needing to put in a credit card</b>. 

# What if I get asked for a credit card.

As far as I know, if you are following the instructions on this website (pconrad-webapps), <b>you shouldn't be asked for a credit card.</b>

It is possible that by the time you read this, that may have changed.   It is also possible&mdash;particularly if you are following these
instructions as part of a school assignment&mdash;if you get asked for a credit card, that you
are doing something "wrong", or at the very least, something that is not necessary for the assignment you've been given.

# Setting up your account.
