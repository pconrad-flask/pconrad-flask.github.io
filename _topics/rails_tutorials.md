# Specific Topics

## Testing

* "How I Test" : <http://railscasts.com/episodes/275-how-i-test>
    * "Here I show how I would add tests to the password reset feature created in the previous episode. I use RSpec, Capybara, Factory Girl, and Guard to make request, model, and mailer specs."
* "Factories not Fixtures": <http://railscasts.com/episodes/158-factories-not-fixtures-revised>
    * "Fixtures are external dependencies which can make tests brittle and difficult to read. In this episode I show how to use Factory Girl to generate the needed records directly in the tests." 
* "Request Specs and Capybara": <http://railscasts.com/episodes/257-request-specs-and-capybara>
    * "Request specs in RSpec are a great way to ensure the entire application stack is working properly. Here I also show how to use capybara with integrated JavaScript testing using Selenium."
