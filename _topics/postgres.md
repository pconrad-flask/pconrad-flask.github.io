# Postgres (also called PostgreSQL) is an implementation on an SQL database.   

* It is an alternative choice to sqlite3 and MySQL.

# Why would I choose Postgres over sqlite3 or MySQL?

* If you are developing an app for practice only, and running only on your local system, sqlite3 is probably the easiest choice.
* If you want to be able to run on Heroku, postgres is the clear winner.
