If you work with SparkJava, one of the things you'll encounter is that 
it has a dependency on the Simple Logging Framework for Java, also known by
its acronym, *SLF4J*.

This logging framework requires a bit of configuration if:

* you *don't* want to see annoying error messages
* you *do* want to see helpful log messages

At the bottom of this article are some pointers to more details.  But for now, here is the minimum that you need to know
to get SLF4J working for you in the context of a SparkJava project.
