Ruby on Rails, often just called  *Rails* is a web development platform based on the programming language Ruby.

# Deployment

For apps developed in Rails:

* They can be deployed in the cloud on [Heroku](/topics/heroku)
* Continous integration is available through [Travis-CI](/topics/travis-ci/)

# Getting Started

1.  Install rvm.
    * It isn't absolutely necessary, but it is very helpful, to install the Ruby Version Manager (rvm) first.
    * Installing rvm allows you, when you are working on Rails project, to be always consistently use the same version of
        Ruby and of Rails each time you work on the project, even across different systems.
