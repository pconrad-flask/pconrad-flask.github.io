The instructions on this page assume that you've:

* already done the initial set up steps on the page [MongoDB: MLab](/topics/mongodb_mlab/)
to sign up for an mlab account, and create a so-called "new private environment", and that you have then
* created a database, following the instructions at [MongoDB: MLab Database Creation](/topics/mongodb_mlab_database_creation/)

The next step is to create at least one user, and at least one collection. This page will walk you through the process.
