# Why host a [Jekyll](/topics/jekyll/) site on Heroku

Perhaps the easiest way to work with Jeykll is on Github Pages.  You don't have to worry much about deployment, and the hosting is
already included in your free open source Github plan.

Nevertheless, there are some use cases where you might want to host a Jeykll site on Heroku:

* You want fault-tolerance: a backup in case Github Pages has an outage
* You want to use add-ons that Github Pages doesn't support
