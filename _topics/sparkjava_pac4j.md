The library Pac4J, online at [http://www.pac4j.org/](http://www.pac4j.org/) is a kind of swiss army knife for Java Web App Security.  
It can be used with SparkJava, but with many other frameworks as well.

The github repo [https://github.com/pac4j/spark-pac4j](https://github.com/pac4j/spark-pac4j) offers a bridge from SparkJava to Pac4J.

The [README.md](https://github.com/pac4j/spark-pac4j/blob/master/README.md) file from that repo offers a tutorial.   This page will 
provide any additional information you might need to supplement what is there.
