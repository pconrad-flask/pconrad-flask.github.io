MongoDB is one of several implementations of what has come to be known as NoSQL databases.

# NoSQL databases in general

These are database systems that:

* are NOT based on the relational database model of tables with rows and columns
* do NOT use SQL for queries (e.g. `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = "fred";`

Since NoSQL databases are defined in terms of what they are *not*, what they *are* tends to 
vary a bit, but they are typically some kind of key/value store: think of them as a *dictionary
in the cloud*.

What you lose, as compared to SQL databases, is the power of the SQL query language.  What you 
gain is simplicity.    That's a gross oversimplification, but for purposes of this article it will do&mdash;if you want to know more, do a web search on `SQL vs NOSQL`.

# MongoDB vs. MLab

On this site, we'll describe a provider of MongoDB called MLab. 

* MondoDB is a technology
* MLab is one commerical cloud provider of that technology

We focus on MLab mainly because it has a free tier that does not require a credit card. The goal of this website is to support students (broadly defined&mdash;whether formally enrolled at a school or not).     So we want to focus on techniques for learning that have a few barriers in place as possible.
