Many websites have some kind of image gallery as a feature.

Depending on the use case, an image gallery on a site may involve:
* only client-side software (e.g. a library built on JavaScript, or a JavaScript framework).   This would be most common when your images are pretty static, and adding/deleting/changing images is going to be done manually by a webmaster, rather than be end users.
* a mix of client and server-side software.    This would be more common when end users will need to add, delete and modify images.  A back-end solution is needed so that there is some persistent image storage.

It is also possible to do an image gallery with a server-side only solution, but such a solution is unlikely to be satisfactory for the way in 
which people view web content now (a mix of screen types, from monitor, to tablet, to phone sized).
