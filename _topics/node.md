node.js is a package that can be used to make web applications that run JavaScript on the server side.

Installing node also provides a JavaScript CLI (REPL) on Unix/Windows/Mac systems, as well as a way to use
JavaScript as a basic scripting language (separated from any web browser.)

Webapps developed in node can be deployed on Heroku.
