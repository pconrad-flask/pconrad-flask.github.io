node.js is a package that can be used to make web applications that run JavaScript on the server side.

Installing node also provides a JavaScript CLI (REPL) on Unix/Windows/Mac systems, as well as a way to use
JavaScript as a basic scripting language (separated from any web browser.)

* They can be deployed in the cloud on [Heroku](/topics/heroku)
