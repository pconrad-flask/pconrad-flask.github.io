JavaScript is important for web development for at least two reasons:

1. Nearly all client-side web programming in done in JavaScript, because there is pretty much no alternative. 
2. Some server-side programming is also done in JavaScript, using the `node.js` framework, for example.

There are at least three separate aspects of "learning JavaScript" that you may want to consider separately, and/or in relationship to one another.

1. Learning JavaScript *as a programming language*, in the abstract.
2. Learning JavaScript *as it is used, in practice* for client-side web application programming.
3. Learning JavaScript *as it is used in `node.js` for server-side web programming, or for command line applications.

Here are a few resources for learning JavaScript, and where each one is useful.
