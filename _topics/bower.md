# What is Bower?

From [Bower's main web page](https://bower.io/) (retrieved 2016-06-19):

> Web sites are made of lots of things — frameworks, libraries, assets, and utilities. Bower manages all these things for you.
>
> Keeping track of all these packages and making sure they are up to date (or set to the specific versions you need) is tricky. Bower to the rescue!
>
> Bower can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files. 
> Bower doesn’t concatenate or minify code or do anything else&mdash;it just installs
> the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies.
>
> To get started, Bower works by fetching and installing packages from all over, 
> taking care of hunting, finding, downloading, and saving the stuff you’re looking for. 
> Bower keeps track of these packages in a manifest file, bower.json. 
> How you use packages is up to you. 
> Bower provides hooks to facilitate using packages in your tools and workflows.
>
> Bower is optimized for the front-end. If multiple packages depend on a package&mdash;jQuery for example&mdash;Bower
> will download jQuery just once. This is known as a flat dependency graph and it helps reduce page load.
