# Why should I set up continuous integration for a [Jekyll](/topics/jekyll/) site on Travis-CI

Setting up a [Jekyll](/topics/jekyll/) site on Github Pages is super convenient.

But one thing Github Pages didn't provide is *access to the error messages* that you get when your site is set up 
incorrectly.   Instead, you just get a "404 unavailable" message, or your site doesn't update (your changes don't 
seem to have any effect.)

The best way to remedy this&mdash;in fact its Github Pages own suggestion&mdash;is to set up continuous integration for
your Jekyll site via Travis-CI.

TODO: Explain how to do it here.
