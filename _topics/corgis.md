The Corgis is a collection of datasets that can be used as the basis of a variety of apps, including Flask webapps.

The Corgis pages have a collection of datasets for Python, however I encourage you to look instead at the JSON collection, here:

In the pages that follow, we'll walk you through the process of creating a simple webapp based on one of the Corgis datasets.
